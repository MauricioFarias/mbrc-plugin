====================

About

The plugin acts as a socket server (TCP) that listens for incoming connections. The plugin implements a JSON based protocol functionality that is translated to calls to the MusicBee API.

Building
-------
To build the plugin you have to open it with Visual Studio 2012. After opening the project you will probably have to restore the required packages with NuGet.

Protocol
-------
All the protocol messages have the following format ``{"context":"command","type":"type","data":"data"}`` you can find all the available commands at the [Constants.cs](https://github.com/kelsos/mbrc-plugin/blob/development/AndroidRemote/Networking/Constants.cs) file. The type can be has one of the following values **req** for request, **rep** for reply and **msg** for message, but they are currently ignored. The data contains the data part of the Protocol. In requests it contains data send to the server for example during the volume change it contains the integer of the new volume e.g. `` {"context":"playervolume","type":"req","data":10}``. In the replies it may contain more complex data like Arrays of tracks etc.
